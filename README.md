* conducting development, and managing development tools, platforms and practices
* developing and implementing principles of licensing and distribution
* providing second-line support to NIIS members.

The **[NIIS Members](https://www.niis.org/organization-and-management/)**

**Working Group**. The NIIS organizes and facilitates Advisory Group and
Working Group meetings.
