### X-Road Development 'Big Picture'

![](IMG/xroad_development.png)

The [Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions](https://niis.org) (NIIS)
owns the X-Road product and maintains Product Roadmap and Product Backlog. The
NIIS is responsible for:

* management, development, verification, and audit of the source code
* administration of documentation
* administration of business and technical requirements
* conducting development, and managing development tools, platforms and practices
* developing and implementing principles of licensing and distribution
* providing second-line support to NIIS members.

The NIIS **Members** nominate representatives to the **Advisory Group** and
participate in the **Working Group**. The NIIS organizes and facilitates
Advisory Group and Working Group meetings.

Members also submit feature and enhancement requests, submit code contributions,
prioritize backlog and use X-Road for producing digital services. Members are
responsible for running and maintaining their own X-Road ecosystems and
providing support to their ecosystems.

### X-Road Community
